HTML:

    In addition to the HTTP headers that include status codes, the bits representing an image or website will be sent to you
    The language that builds websites is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
    Sent as a response for a request for a web page
    HTML isn’t a programming language but rather a markup language
    Allows you to format, but doesn’t have control flow such as loops and conditions

    style:

        <!DOCTYPE html>

        <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <title>hello, world</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                hello, world
            </body>
        </html>

    This is html for a webpage that says “hello, world”

    To implement webpages, you need to write HTML

    Editors like Atom and Sublime Text exist to help write HTML

    Ultimately, all you need is a computer, a keyboard, and some way of typing out text.

    <!DOCTYPE html>:

        Lets the browser know the following file is written in HTML 5

    <html lang="en">:

        Specifies that the webpage is written in English

    <head></head>:

        Example of open and close tags
        First tag opened is the last tag closed

        HTML is a tag-based markup language
            Tags have attributes

    Standard extension for a webpage is .html


    In the top corner of the browser tab is the title

        This comes from the head
        The body contains 99% of the webpage’s content

    Not on a web server, so no one else can access it:

        There are web hosts to serve up websites we write

Atom:

    TextEdit is not designed for web page development
    Free alternatives made for web development exist
    Atom is an example of one of these editors Atom

        In Atom, you can open multiple files at once
        Colors are added for readability

    These colors don’t effect how the webpage will render
    HTML supports comments, <!--comments-->

Links:

    Links can make our pages more dynamic by linking to other pages
    <a></a> are anchor tags that can be used for links
    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>link</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            Visit <a href="http://www.harvard.edu/">Harvard</a>.
        </body>
    </html>

    href (hyper reference) is set to where you want the link to go

    Blue, underlined text traditionally represents a link on a webpage

    The bottom left corner on Chrome shows the destination of a link when you hover over the text

    A link traditionally becomes purple if you’ve already followed that link
    Browser remembers where you’ve been
        
        Note: this is a potential privacy concern

Images:

    The web is filled with images

    <img> is the image tag

    <!DOCTYPE html>

    <html lang="en">
        <head>
            <title>image</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <img alt="Grumpy Cat" src="cat.jpg"/> 
        </body>
    </html>

    The src (source) attribute is set to the address of the file

    The alt (alternative text) attribute is what displays if the page can’t be seen

    Closes itself as one tag, these are special cases
