HTML notes

What is HTML?
    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
    HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
    HTML describes the structure of a Web page
    HTML consists of a series of elements
    HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
    HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

    A Simple HTML Document

        Example:
            
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
            </head>
            <body>

            <h1>My First Heading</h1>
            <p>My first paragraph.</p>

            </body>
            </html>

        Example Explained;

            The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document

            The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page

            The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page

            The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)

            The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, 
            such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

            The <h1> element defines a large heading

            The <p> element defines a paragraph

    What is an HTML Element?:

        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

        <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
        
        The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

        <h1>My First Heading</h1>
        <p>My first paragraph.</p>
       
        Start tag	Element content	       End tag
        <h1>	    My First Heading	   </h1>

        <p>      	My first paragraph.	   </p>

        <br>	       none	               none

        Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). 
            These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

    Web Browsers:

        The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

        A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:

            HTML Page Structure:

                Below is a visualization of an HTML page structure:

                <html>
                    <head>
                        <title>Page title</title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <h1>This is a heading</h1>
                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                        <p>This is another paragraph.</p>
                    </body>
                </html>

                Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. 
                The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

HTML Documents:

    All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <!DOCTYPE html>.

    The HTML document itself begins with <html> and ends with </html>.

    The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

    The <!DOCTYPE> Declaration:
    
        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

        It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).

        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive.

        The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html>
    
    HTML Headings:

        HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

        <h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

    HTML Paragraphs:

        HTML paragraphs are defined with the <p> tag.

    HTML Links:

        HTML links are defined with the <a> tag:

        Example:

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

        The link's destination is specified in the href attribute. 

            Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.

    HTML Images:

        HTML images are defined with the <img> tag.

        The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

        Example:

            <img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

HTML Tag Reference:

    W3Schools' tag reference contains additional information about these tags and their attributes.

    Tag	Description:

    <html>	Defines the root of an HTML document
    <body>	Defines the document's body
    <h1> to <h6>	Defines HTML headings

    All tags: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp 

HTML Attributes;

    All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag
    Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

    The href Attribute;

        The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.

    The src Attribute;

        The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed

        There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

        1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. 
        Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, 
        you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; 
        it can suddenly be removed or changed.

        2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. 
        Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. 
        Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

        Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

    The width and height Attributes:
    
        The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

        Example:

            <img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

    The alt Attribute:

        The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, 
        if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, 
        or if the user uses a screen reader.

        Example:

            <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

    The style Attribute:

        The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.
